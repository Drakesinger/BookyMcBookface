A simple, very unfancy (and somewhat deficient) e-book reader. Loads epub, txt, and html books. See [https://github.com/quaap/BookyMcBookface Github]  for the full feature list and instructions. If you find a problem with a particular book, file a bug report!

It was created specifically so that I could have a free and open-source software (FOSS) epub reader on my phone. It is very basic on purpose! :)
